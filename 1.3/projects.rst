Creating a New Project
==========================================================
Projects are designed to help organize your workflow within XTMF.  Projects contain multiple model systems and provide logical grouping of model system runs.  In order to run a model system, it must to be contained within a project.

After you have selected ‘Create a new project’ you will be prompted to enter a name.

Project names do have some restrictions. The name entry dialog will inform you if the name entered is invalid.

Otherwise you can just press Enter or click on the button ‘OK’ to create the new project.  Once project creation is completed, the interface will automatically navigate to the newly created project page.

Interacting with Projects
==========================================================
If you instead want to load a project, or work with your projects, you can either click on Open Project from the Start screen or through the menu at File -> Open -> Project.  Doing so will bring up a screen as shown here.   From this we can work with the different projects that we have.  You can additionally create a new project, rename projects, clone projects, delete them, and of course open them by double clicking or selecting the project and pressing enter.
Most actions besides loading a project cannot be done if the project is currently open.

Importing a Model System into a Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To import a model system selected the Import button at the bottom of the project page.  This will bring up a dialog to select what project to import.  Double click or select and press enter to select the model system you want to import.  Please use the search box to help find the model system that you want to import if you have many.
Once you’ve selected a model system you will be prompted to name what it will be called within your project. In the next image I’ve decided to name the model system ‘Demo’.

Finally, we have our project setup with our model system imported into it.
Once this is done we are now able to start editing that model system within the project.  As we will cover later, when you edit a model system within a project, those changes are not back propagated back to the model system that we imported.

Importing a Model System from File into a Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A model system can also be imported from another location other than the active model system directory.  To import a model system from file, click the “Import [ Model System from File]” button on the active project page. A file dialog will be displayed where you can navigate to the location of the model system that you will import. Navigate to the XML file that defines the model system.
