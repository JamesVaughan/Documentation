# General Base Workflow
Associated tool names in italics
1. Start with the pristine, fully NCS11-compliant full base network
2. Import a zone system if one is not in place. Use a scenario known to work fine. (Copy Zone System)
3. (might not be required) Connect centroids (CCGEN). 
4. Create a node extra attribute (default value = 1) to allow for removal of transit stops later on (Create extra attribute)
5. (might not be required) Create a link extra attribute (default value = 0) called @z407. (Create extra attribute)
6. (might not be required) Assign values to @z407. Can be loaded in from a text file. (Import attribute values)
7. (in development) Make an aggregation selection file so that headway generation can be performed using na√Øve or average aggregation. (Create Aggregation Selection File)
8. Split the full base into time period bases. (Create Time Period Network)
AM = 0600-0900
MD = 0900-1500
PM = 1500-1900
EV = 1900-2400
ON = 0000-0600
9. Assign values to us1 for all transit segments. Filter:
line=______ xor line=TS____ xor line=GT____
 (Prorate transit speeds)
10. Clean the time period networks using the parameters listed (Remove Extra Nodes). Apply @stop as the stop filter.
vdf: force
length: sum
type: first
lanes: force
ul1: avg
ul2: force
ul3: force
dwt: sum
dwfac: force
ttf: force
us1: avg_by_length
us2: avg
us3: avg
@stn1: force
@stn2: force

11. In order to send an edited network back to the network caretaker, first make sure to remove the zone system. Use Delete Nodes with subset i = 0,9000
12. Then use Export Network Package to prepare the network for sending.
