# Place of Residence - Place of School

## Overview

The place of residence – place of school model in GTAModel V4.0 is simple in comparison to its work counterpart.  First we take the distributions from the 2011 TTS and then update them to the forecast year’s population totals.  After this aggregate model has finished producing the linkages as the population is being loaded they are discreetly assigned zones.  Once a person is assigned a zone the probabilities are adjusted accordingly so that we don’t have substitution.

Separate linkages are stored for elementary, high school, and university aged persons.
