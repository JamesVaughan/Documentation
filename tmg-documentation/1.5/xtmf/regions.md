# Model System Regions

Model system regions is a new feature added in XTMF 1.5 that provides an alternative view to the standard hierarchical / tree model system view. Regions allow the modeller to place modules into logical groupings separately from the base model system layout. 

## What are regions?

A region (or region display) is the top level grouping for modules when using this feature. A model system can have any number of regions. Regions are the parent container for "groups".

## What are region groups?

Region groups are child groups of regions. Region groups are the logical container that modules are collected under. A region group must be created as part of a parent region display.
