# Population Synthesis

## Overview

GTAModelV4 has a population synthesized from the TTS (Transportation for Tomorrow Survey) records.

### Required Software and Dependencies

1. MySql Server 5.5 or greater
2. Python V3 or greater with required package dependencies dependencies

### Installation and Setup

#### Mysql Server Installation

If you do not have a copy of MySQL Server - an installer is available for download at <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/.> A minimum version of version 5.5 of the Community Edition is required.

During the installation process, keep note of the server isntallation's root password that you provide. A valid database user and password is required is required to connect to the database server.

##### Creating a Database

Apart from the MySQL Server installation, a database must be created with the proper access privileges for the user account used to connect to the server.

(TODO)


#### Python Installation


##### Installing Package Dependencies

#### Input Configuration

GTAModel's population synthesis procedure requires defining its inputs through a JSON formatted configuration file. A blank / schema version of the required input format is provided for guidance in creating the properly structured input.

The default configuration JSON has the following format:

```json
{
	"DatabaseName": "",
	"DatabasePassword": "",
	"DatabaseUser": "",
	"DatabaseServer": "",
	"PersonsSeedFile": "",
	"HouseholdsSeedFile": "",
	"MazLevelControls": "",
	"TazLevelControls": "",
	"MetaLevelControls": "",
	"Java64Path": "C:\\Path\\To\\Jre",
	"PopSyn3SettingsFile": "runtime\\config\\settings.xml",
	"CategoryMapping": {
		"Persons": [
			{
				"FieldName": "",

				"MappedValue": 0
			}
		],
		"Households": [
			{
				"FieldName": "",

## Population Synthesis Procedure

### Pre-processing Input Data

### Starting a Run

After the required input configuration has been finalized, the population synthesis procedure can be run. The file `run.py` is the main python script that begins the synthesis procedure. These steps involve reading the input data and configuration settings. This information is then used to create and process the required database tables used by PopSyn3.

> [!NOTE]
> Please ensure that your MySQL server is started before starting the synthesis procedure.
