# V4Input Directory Structure

This section describes how files are organized within the XTMF project input directory.  Depending on your base version of GTAModel
the exact structure will change.  If your model system was constructed outside of TMG please contact your provider for
your model's specific layout.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a significant change in file structure starting in GTAModel V4.0.2 and continuing into GTAModel V4.1 in order to help organize model runs.
