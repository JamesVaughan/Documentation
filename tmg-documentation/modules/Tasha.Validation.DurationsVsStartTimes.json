As an input, it takes in the newly scheduled households and then produces different files for the different purposes. For each purpose, the module records when the trips start (hour). It then computes and records the average duration for all trips that start at a common start hour. As an output, the module produces average durations for each start hour data for all observed trip purposes scheduled by TASHA.</p>Note: The module can also be used on real data instead of TASHA run data. This is important when one wants to validate the duration of trips that TASHA is scheduling.","IconURI":null,"Name":null,"DocURL":null,"TypeId":"XTMF.ModuleInformationAttribute, XTMFInterfaces, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"}}
