It also tries to read in the standard header (an example is given in the ReadODTextData module).  \r\nWhat makes this module different from the ReadODTextData is that it will filter out records based \r\non the third column instead of returning all of the records.  This is useful when implementing the \r\nNon-Work/School trips to be able to filter out by occupation type.","IconURI":null,"Name":null,"DocURL":null,"TypeId":"XTMF.ModuleInformationAttribute, XTMFInterfaces, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"}}
