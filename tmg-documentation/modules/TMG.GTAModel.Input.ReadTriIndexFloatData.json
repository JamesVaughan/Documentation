Following that it is \r\nexpecting the first two columns to represent the indexes of the first two dimensions.  \r\nThe third dimension is expressed by its “Data-column Sparse Space” parameter and the reading \r\nof that data in the columns that follow along in the row.  These columns are then linked to sparse \r\nspaces by referencing each column to the parameter, thusly the number of columns for data are expected \r\nto be the same as in the parameter.","IconURI":null,"Name":null,"DocURL":null,"TypeId":"XTMF.ModuleInformationAttribute, XTMFInterfaces, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"}}
