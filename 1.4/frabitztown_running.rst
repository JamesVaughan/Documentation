Running Frabitztown
=============================================================================
Now that the model system has finally been completed, it is now time to perform a run. XTMF currently only supports a single run at any time. In order to perform multiple runs, the previous run must
first be completed.

   XTMF interface with the model system run dialog active.

The run will finish once the status reaches 100% complete. On the Model System Run pane, click *Open Run Output*. A file explorer window will open located in the run's output directory. Here all files output during the execution
of the model system will be present.

The traffic counts and transit boarding extractions setup in the previous steps will also be here.
