Updated GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
XTMF 1.4 now uses a more modern layout. Although 1.3 introduced a new look and feel, 1.4 further improves on that by using 
material design by Google which is more familiar to a much larger percentage of users. Earlier versions of XTMF included a 
standard File menu for application actions. This has been removed and replaced with a "global" window menu which attempts to behave
more similarily to native Windows applications. The menu has been placed in a sidebar which can be called from any section or tab of
the XTMF.Gui application.
