What's new in XTMF Version 1.4?

Updated GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
XTMF 1.4 now uses a more modern layout. Although 1.3 introduced a new look and feel, 1.4 further improves on that by using 
material design by Google which is more familiar to a much larger percentage of users. Earlier versions of XTMF included a 
standard File menu for application actions. This has been removed and replaced with a "global" window menu which attempts to behave
more similarily to native Windows applications. The menu has been placed in a sidebar which can be called from any section or tab of
the XTMF.Gui application.

Unified Runs Under the Scheduler Window
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Model system runs will now appear under the same window: the Scheduler window. The scheduler window introduces two run lists "active" and "finished",
which provides a useful overview of all past, present (and future) runs that have been initiated by the XTMF client. 

Run Queueing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Model system runs can now be queued. XTMF 1.4 introduces the ability to both schedule and queue model system runs. A user can choose to have runs
execute simultaneously. This feature allows the user to postphone the starting of a model system run to a later date in time when there will be more
computing resources available, without having to actively be present at their workstation.
