# **Travel Modelling Group** - User Guides and Documentation v1.4.

Travel Modelling Group is a research group housed within the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Toronto. In addition to acting as a nexus for collaboration between the Province of Ontario's various transportation agencies, TMG strives to maintain a public-oriented focus by developing open source tools that make a meaningful contribution to the domain of transportation planning and research. 

Part of the development of public-domain tools that are willingly adopted by new users is maintaing an up-to-date user guide and documentation.
