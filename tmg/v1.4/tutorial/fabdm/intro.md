# Frabitztown Agent-Based Demand Model

The FABDM tutorial will go over building a model system from start to finish. Included with this tutorial are the necessary input files that are required to work through the guide and replicate the output demonstrated here. This guide was written for XTMF 1.4 - other versions may not be suitable or be exactly similar to this version of the tutorial.

The first section of the guide will go over the background of XTMFâ€™s test city "Frabitztown", its population, network and other miscellaneous data required to build a test model system. The following sections will outline the steps required to build the model system from the ground up. Included will be tips and suggestions for efficient usage of XTMF. Lastly, a simple scenario will be used to demonstrate the run process within model systems, and how to utilize their outputs.
