Frabitztown: A Model System from Start to Finish
###############################################################
This part of the tutorial will go over builing a model system from start to finish. Included with this tutorial are the necessary
input files that are required to work through the guide and replicate the output demonstrated here. This guide was written for XTMF 1.3 -
other versions may not be suitable for use with this tutorial.

The first section of the guide will go over the background of XTMF's test city, population, network and other miscellaneous data
required to build a test model system. The second section will outline the steps required to build the model system from the ground up. Included will be tips and suggestions for efficient usage of XTMF. Lastly, a simple scenario will be used to demonstrate the run process within model systems, and
how to utilize their outputs.
